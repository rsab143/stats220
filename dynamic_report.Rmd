## Analyzing YouTube Ads and Viewer Interest

This report analyzes YouTube advertisements based on user observations. It tracks the number of ads seen, their types, and whether they interested viewers.

```{r data_import}
# Import data from Google Sheets
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTjWcTc323INPV1cOxnEVqo7tMfDb6261ivV90QYsxdFEDGJNsgQJQRBpdnkhIT4H4YhhN-iCwJ0aRI/pub?output=csv")

# Rename columns for better readability
latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(
    ads_seen = `How many ads did you see on a recent youtube video you have just watched?`,  
    ad_type = `What type of ads did you see?`,  
    interest_level = `Did these ads interest you in any way?`  
  )

# Calculate summary statistics
min_ads <- min(latest_data$ads_seen, na.rm = TRUE)
max_ads <- max(latest_data$ads_seen, na.rm = TRUE)
avg_ads <- mean(latest_data$ads_seen, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Summary of Ads Observed

- The minimum number of ads seen: `r min_ads`
- The maximum number of ads seen: `r max_ads`
- The average number of ads seen per observation: `r round(avg_ads, 2)`

```{r ad_type_plot}
# Bar chart for most common ad types
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = ad_type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Most Common Ad Types", x = "Ad Type", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r interest_level_plot}
# Bar chart for interest level in ads
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = interest_level)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Viewer Interest in Ads", x = "Interest Level", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
